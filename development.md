# Project Log

Initial project structure created by the Laravel command line utility.

# First User Story: Signing up for a user account. 


User authentication added like this:

$ php artisan make:auth

This generated HomeController and views for login, registration, password reset and so on.


Added Procfile for Heroku.


Changed AppServiceProvider to set MySQL default string length (necessary for user tokens to work).


That covers the user story for signing up for a user account.



# Next user story: A logged-in user can post his holiday-home advertisement to the site.

UI, Routing, database,...!



# UI design

# Database design for advertisement. 

Generate a new table

$ php artisan ...?
